to run the project use make all
this will create executeables with the names : server, client and test_server test_stack
run the server and then the client
run the test executeable to test the stack and the server
make sure the server is running before you test it


Bonuses:
1) We implemnted a double ended queue , instead a regular stack
2) Our code can be run in both linux and Windows
